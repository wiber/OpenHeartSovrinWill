---

- **Structural Foundations (🔵)** propagate influence through **Resource Alignment (🟠)** and **Trust Mechanisms (🟣)**, reducing entropy and increasing efficiency.
- **Interaction Dynamics (🔴)** enhance **Global Collaboration**, leading to **Nash Equilibria (⚖️)**, optimizing collective outcomes.
- **Cognitive Processes (🟡)** improve **Findability (🟤)** and drive **Innovation (⚫️)**, overcoming learned helplessness.
- **Outcomes (🟢)** are achieved by integrating **Sustainability (🟥)** and **Ethical Alignment (⚪️)**, ensuring long-term value and addressing alignment issues.

By visualizing strong interactions with multiple color dots, we highlight the **inter-category submatrices**—the deep connections between components. This structure reflects the FIM's unique capability to:

- **Optimize Energy Efficiency** by aligning resources and reducing structural entropy.
- **Enhance Structural Findability** through the FIM mapping framework, making knowledge accessible.
- **Facilitate Nash Equilibria**, ensuring fair and optimal cooperation.
- **Overcome Learned Helplessness** by empowering individuals with better access to information and tools.
- **Ensure Ethical Alignment and Sustainability**, addressing critical alignment issues unique to the FIM.
