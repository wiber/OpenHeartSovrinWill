# 🔥 FIM-Enhanced Mistral: Structured Attention Optimization

## 🚀 Overview
This project integrates the **Fractal Identity Matrix (FIM)** into **Mistral**, optimizing transformer attention mechanisms for structured reasoning, hierarchical memory, and reduced computational overhead.

By leveraging **FIM-based token positioning**, this implementation significantly **reduces search space complexity**, enhancing both training and inference efficiency.

## 🌍 Why FIM?
🚀 **Drastically Reduces Compute Overhead**  
🔍 **Enhances Interpretability** - Attention weights align with structured reasoning  
🧠 **Improves AI Memory & Retrieval** - Tokens retrieve structured relationships dynamically  
📈 **Optimized Attention** - Moves from **O(N²) to O(N log N)** complexity  

## 🛠 Features
✅ **FIM-Driven Token Embedding:** Tokens inherit **fractal coordinates** for structured lookup  
✅ **Hierarchical Attention Masking:** Self-attention operates **within structured groups**  
✅ **Sparse Attention Routing:** Enables non-local context retrieval dynamically  
✅ **RL-Based FIM Optimization:** Transformer **self-learns optimal FIM layouts** over time  

## 🏗 Integration Points (Modules Modified)
| **Module** | **Description of Change** | **Estimated LoC** |
|------------|--------------------------|-------------------|
| `tokenization.py` | Assigns **FIM hierarchical coordinates** instead of flat token indices | **200-400** |
| `attention.py` | Implements **FIM-aware sparse attention masking** | **600-1000** |
| `attention_scores.py` | Adjusts weight calculations for **FIM-prioritized token focus** | **400-600** |
| `residuals.py` | Modifies **residual connections** to preserve hierarchical structure | **200-500** |
| `embeddings.py` | Embeds **FIM-based hierarchical positioning** | **300-500** |
| `reinforcement_learning.py` | Implements **RL-driven FIM optimization** | **800-1200** |

## 📜 Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch
- Mistral LLM
- CUDA (for acceleration)
- NumPy / SciPy (for matrix ops)
- RL Libraries (Stable-Baselines3 for reinforcement learning)

## 💾 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/fim-mistral.git
cd fim-mistral
pip install -r requirements.txt
🔥 How It Works
1️⃣ Tokenization Stage:
Tokens are assigned fractal coordinates rather than simple numerical indices.

2️⃣ Self-Attention Optimization:
Attention masks out irrelevant tokens using structured FIM-based groupings.

3️⃣ Sparse Attention Routing:
Tokens dynamically query non-local context based on FIM structure.

4️⃣ RL-Based Self-Optimization:
Transformer learns which hierarchical structures optimize retrieval.
