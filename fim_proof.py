FIM Proof-of-Concept with Exhaustive Explanations

This script validates core Fractal Identity Map (FIM) properties—each test is documented
to explain:
  - Why we expect this behavior (from our chat and patent claims).
  - What the numeric results show.
  - How it ties back to exponential skip-pruning, self-legending semantic addresses,
    constant-time explainability, and drift resistance.

Patent Concepts Demonstrated:
  - Self-similar (fractal) skip factor: (c/t)^(n*d)
  - One-hop reverse lookup for explainability
  - Self-legending coordinates (prefix ordering by weight)
  - Threshold-based pruning (heavy-tail retention)
  - Continuous monotonic pruning effect
